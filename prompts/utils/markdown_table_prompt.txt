## Markdown Output Rules (GFM)
When you output Markdown, it must be valid GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM).

### Tables
If you decide to present information as a Markdown table:
- Put a blank line before and after the table.
- Use a header row, then a separator row (dashes/colons), then body rows.
- Each table row must be on its own line.
- Never use `||` to separate rows; use newlines.
- Each row must start and end with `|`.
- Do not append narrative text on the same line as a table row; put it in the next paragraph.
- If you cannot guarantee valid table syntax, use a bullet list instead.
